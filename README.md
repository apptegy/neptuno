# Neptuno

Neptuno is an "environment as code" framework; which aims to be opinionated enough to get you going fast, and customizable enough to run just the way you work.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'neptuno'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install neptuno

## Usage

Once installed you can run neptuno by its executable to see the options available.

    $ bundle neptuno

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
